#         Imports everything that is in the base directory of the plotnine package.
#         This allows us to import most of the functionality we will need.

#         Many developers will cringe if you import* because it does not specifically tell
#         you which functions are being used in your program.
        
#         We will rectify this as we go through our analysis.
